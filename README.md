# Vignette Specification Repository

This repository houses our specifications and Specifications that is used as reference for implementing Vignette's open features.

## Our proposal process

A specification starts its life as a RFC Document which is submitted through our Pull Request process. At this stage, we assume your specification is in a draft phase. From here, you will recieve input(s) from the contributors of Vignette and Cosyne Staff.  For your specification to be ratified, it needs to be signed and approved by the project leads.

Once a specification has been approved, it will get some revisions before it gets wholly accepted into the repository. Keep in mind every document in the repository is **immutable** - no changes are allowed once merged. Any amendments must be done as a seperate document to undergo the RFC process again.
